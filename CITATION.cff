abstract: >-
  TIBET (Transaction/Interaction-Based Evidence Trail) is a protocol
  for establishing complete provenance chains in AI-to-AI and
  AI-to-human interactions. tibet-core is the reference implementation:
  a 50KB Rust kernel with Python, JavaScript/WASM, and C bindings.
  Three lines of code for cryptographically signed, chainable,
  verifiable provenance tokens.
